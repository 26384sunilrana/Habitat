      Hint: Body
      Value: |
        <p>When following the Package Principles or traditional modular architecture there exists no layers. Actually modular architecture is often seen as an approach to going away from the traditional 3 tiered architecture (UI, business logic, data).&nbsp;Layers in the Habitat methodology is not this kind of layers.</p>
        <p>The layered approach in Sitecore Habitat is aimed at tightly controlling dependencies between modules and thereby is a vital part of the architectural approach.</p>
        <p>The structure is split into three layers: Project, Features and Foundation, which all consists of modules. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Foundation layer consists of services which are common across the whole or parts of the solution.</li>
            <li>Features - or the functionality of the solution - is built as modules in the Feature layer.</li>
            <li>The unified solution, websites or channels, are brought together in one or more Project layer modules.</li>
        </ul>
